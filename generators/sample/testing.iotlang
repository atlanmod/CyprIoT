// Requirements
// - For each thing you provide a thingml file, the file has to be error free otherwise it will not generate code
// - The exposed ports has to have the same name than the targeted port in thingml
// - Imports in the file are not supported, the model has to be self-contained, i.e all the info regarding the file has to be in the file itself

	// Arduino that senses the temperature
	config="sample.thingml"
	exposePort inout

thing AirConditionner {
	// Android that handles the air conditionner
	exposePort poo
	config="sample.thingml"
	exposePort inout

thing Monitor {
	// Simple android application that give the user the possibility to select the temperature
	exposePort inout

	rule Temperature deny:send AirConditionner
		// What does this mean?
	// Does Temperature send to monitor?
	// 1) a Temperature will not send if the topic is readable by AirConditionner
	//    Temperature does not send to room2, monitor does not read
	// 2) a Temperature will not send if the message is read only by AirConditionner
	//    Temperature sends to room2, monitor reads
	// 3) same semantics as the inverse rule (do we need send?)
	//    Temperature sends to room2
	// 4) We split topics: room2/AirConditionner, room22/Monitor, we block sending to room2/AirConditionner

	// Inverse rule (what's the difference?)
	// rule AirConditionner deny:receive thing:Temperature
	
	// Rules that talk about instances
	// option 1: rule aircond deny:receive port:Temperature.inout
	// option 2: rule SpecialAirConditionner deny:receive port:Temperature.inout
